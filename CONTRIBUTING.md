# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to `react-tapability`! ❤️

There are a few categories of contribution so we'll go through them individually.

## Documentation

If you think the docs could be improved - please feel free to raise a pull request!

## Bug

If you spot a bug you are welcome to raise it on our issue page. You are also welcome to take a crack at fixing it if you like! When you create an issue you will be prompted with the details we would like you to provide.

## Feature request

If you would like to see a feature added to the library, here is what you do:

1.  Have a read of `README.md` to understand the motivations of this library. It is fairly opinionated and is not intended to be a universal drag and drop library. As such, it will not support every drag and drop interaction.
2.  Have a search through the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/KraigWalker/react-tapability/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue) to see if the feature you are requesting as already been requested.
3.  Have a clear and general purpose keyboard story for any feature request
4.  Please [create an issue](https://github.com/atlassian/KraigWalker/react-tapability/new) to discuss it.

**Please do not raise a pull request directly**. There may be reasons why we will not add every feature to this library.

## Large contributions

If you are interested in making a large contribution to this library there is some recommended reading / training we suggest. There is a large amount of different libraries, techniques and tools used in `react-tapability` and we have created a list with resources about them. Not everything in the list will be applicable to everyone. But it is a great reference and starting point for those who do not know where to start.

The online courses listed are not free - feel free to seek out alternatives if you want to. We recommend the egghead.io courses because they are quite comprehensive.
